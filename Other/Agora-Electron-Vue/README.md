# electron-vue-webpack
Got tired finding Electron/Vue2/Webpack2 templates with fancy add-ons you don't really need?

Give a try to this minimal template with very few dependencies for quick development and prototyping.

![w10 sample](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11739632/19222705/0f8c55fc-8e5f-11e6-97fa-0d3943f43358.png)

## Install
``` bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```

## Usage
Run this command to start developing with hot reloading.
``` bash
# Webpack builds once and watches to apply only the changes
$ npm run dev
```
